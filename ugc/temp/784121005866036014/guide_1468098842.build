		{
			"item_magic_wand"		"A very good item for teamfighting, re-engaging and sustaining. "
			"item_cyclone"		"Can be used either as initiation or escape (remove debuffs or dodge projectiles/spells). Gives movespeed and mana regen to sustain your abilities as well.
Works very well as a setup to multiple of your Spells:
1.Ice Wall
2. Sunstrike
3. Meteor into Blast.
"
			"item_blink"		"Blink Dagger is an item for positioning and initation. It's a great item both offensively and defensively.
You can use it to initiate in multiple ways:

1.Ice Wall into Cold Snap
2. Tornado into Meteor into Blast.
"

			"item_octarine_core"		"Enhances all your abilities and items. Very strong lategame item."
			"item_hand_of_midas"		"Since Invoker is highly level dependent this item is great for him to achieve his item/level goals."
			"item_travel_boots"		"Boots of Travel helps you split push lanes easily. You also get a lot of value out of the move speed and you can join fights easily since youâ€™ll have 2 ways to TP."
			"item_ancient_janggo"		"A very strong utility item early on; gives you movespeed, stats and mana regeneration. Overall a very strong tool for yourself and your team early game. "
			"item_shivas_guard"		"A great teamfighting tool, gives you vision while you use it. Works well against physical damage heroes or heroes with illusions/summons. Increases your survivability as well."
			"item_sheepstick"		"Scythe of Vyse is the strongest disable overall, a perfect item for focusing specific targets."
			"item_sphere"		"Get Linken's Sphere against single target spells that have a high impact against you. You're also a high value target so defensive items are very useful."
			"item_aeon_disk"		"A great item to get on heroes that have key abilities or are priority targets for their foes."
			"item_refresher"		"Double Spells during teamfights, what else can Invoker dream of?"
			"item_force_staff"		"Situationally can be bought against heroes like Riki or heroes with roots."

			"invoker_quas"		"For the Quas + Exort build, max out Exort and stop leveling Quas by level 8.  You'll want to max out Wex after Exort, as you get very little value from leveling up Quas any further."
			"invoker_exort"		"Active Exort orbs gives damage, therefore we are going to max it to last-hit/deny and harass enemies."
			"invoker_wex"		"Active Wex orbs increase Invoker's attack speed, and more importantly movement speed which can be useful for chasing down enemies."

"
			"invoker_cold_snap"		"The freeze stun only triggers on damage greater than 10 after reductions.

Very good synergy with Tornado.

Use EMP immediately on top of the Tornado units. When they land E.M.P will be applied.
"
			"invoker_alacrity"		"Alacrity is a very strong single-target buff on a low cooldown that greatly amplifies the physical damage output of a friendly carry, one of Invoker's summons, or Invoker himself.

Use it on Catapults (Siege creeps) when you're pushing. They will demolish towers.
"
			"invoker_chaos_meteor"		"Deals main damage to enemy units under meteor every 0.5 seconds and burns enemies for smaller damage over 3 seconds.

Combine it with:
1.Tornado

2. Tornado
3. Any lockdown from allied heroes
"

Get the level 15 talent since that will further increase your potential of split-pushing/focusing certain heroes.
"
			"invoker_ice_wall"		"Ice Wall is very strong if placed in the middle of teamfights.

The slow will affect Magic Immune units if they become magic immune afterward the are in the Ice Wall.

Very strong when used to disengage.

Combos:

1.Eul's Scepter into Ice Wall
2. Blink Dagger on top of enemy into Ice Wall
3. Very strong if followed up with Cold Snap
